## PySpark Joins and Aggregations
**Overview**
This script demonstrates various PySpark operations for joins, aggregations, and data transformations, covering real-world data engineering scenarios.

**Features**
Joins: Inner, Left, Right, Full, Anti, and Cross Joins, with support for differently named columns.
Aggregations: Grouping by one or more columns with functions like sum, count, and min.
Data Transformation: Handling hierarchical data, resolving mismatches, and applying conditional logic using expr and withColumn.
RDD to DataFrame: Converts RDDs to DataFrames and aligns schema for processing.
Error Handling: Avoids skewness and ambiguous column references.
